# Repository Template and Usage Guide

## Summary

This repository is designed to serve as a template for all Ceph committees.

## Repository Naming Convention

To maintain a clear and organized naming system, repositories should follow this convention:

{topic}-committee

For example:
* outreach-committee
* hardware-committee
* governance-committee

This naming convention helps identify the purpose and scope of the repository at a glance.

## Required Contents

Every committee repository must include the following files:

### 1. README.md

The README.md file serves as the repository’s introduction and documentation. It should include:

* The goal of the committee.
* The desired outcomes the committee aims to achieve.
* A list of members involved in the committee, including their roles (e.g., chair).

An example template can be found at the bottom of this README


### 2. LICENSE

The LICENSE.md file specifies the repository’s licensing terms. Apache 2.0 is recommended. 

## Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)

While not mandatory, we encourage committees to define and commit to achievable OKRs. These OKRs should follow an 
annual cycle and be documented in a file named YYYY-OKRs.md. A template is provided below.

## Visibility

We encourage committees to keep their repositories public. However there might be valid reasons for a repository
needing to be private, when in doubt please ask the board. 

## Issues and Github Projects

Committees are encouraged to leverage Github issues and projects to organize and track their work. 


## README.md Template

```
# [Committee Name]
 
## Goal

[A committee’s goal should be a clear, actionable, and purpose-driven statement that aligns with
Ceph's broader mission. It should outline the committee’s desired outcome or contribution. For example:

To ensure the Ceph community can efficiently build, test, and release software by addressing the
bottlenecks in the current build environment, enhancing lab capacity, and diversifying infrastructure
to reduce single points of failure. ]

## Desired Outcomes

[Broadly What the committee aims to achieve. For example:

1. Increased Build Capacity
2. Diversified Infrastructure
3. Optimized Resource Utilization
]

## Committee Members

[A list of who is on the committee and their roles if applicable]

* [First Name, Last Name (@githubid) - Role]

```

## YYYY-OKRs.md Template

```
OKR Template
This template provides a structured way to outline Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) broken down by quarters.

## Q1: [Year]

### Objective 1: [State the high-level goal you want to achieve this quarter.]

### Key Results:

[KR 1: Specific measurable result tied to the objective.]
[KR 2: Specific measurable result tied to the objective.]
[KR 3: Specific measurable result tied to the objective.]

```
